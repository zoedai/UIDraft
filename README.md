# UIDraft
Zoe part: menu, clients, reports.

I used a navigation drawer to hold menu and use fragments to hold different views such as client list, travel lists.
There's a floating plus button in the listview so we can add new item. 
It is also the client detail page.
  Inside the detail page there are 3 buttons: edit/ok, travels to this client and expenses with this client.
  edit/ok switch between edit mode and showing mode.
  
Because most of them are listviews with different contents, I have an ItemFragment which we can reuse maybe.
