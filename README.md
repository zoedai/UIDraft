# UIDraft
Zoe part: menu, clients, reports.

I used a navigation drawer to hold menu and use fragments to hold different views such as client list,
travel lists.
There's a floating plus button in the listview so we can add new item. 
It is also the client detail page.

Inside the detail page there is an edit/ok button that switch between edit mode and showing mode.
Below the client detail, there are notes that the user's taken. And a new note button.
Other buttons link to a list fragment for now.
 
Because most of them are listviews with different contents, I have an ItemFragment which we can reuse maybe.
